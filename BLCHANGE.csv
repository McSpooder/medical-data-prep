Has gotten lost in semi-familar areas (going to tax accountant, where she goes once a year), difficulty recently gathering tax records but was able to do it. Got check book out of balance & needed help from proxy. Apparently over spent, giving money/writing checks to junk mail advertisers/organizations. Forgot to go to New Years event that she has been going to every year x 30 years. Reports she was diagnosed dx'd with AD by neurologist. Reports no decline in shopping, cooking, housekeeping, hobbies (playing cards, reading). Will classify as late MCI. Still lives independently with regular help from family or friends.

My assessment is that he is not depressed.  This patient has been in prior studies with our group and he has really not shown signs of depressed mood in the past either.  He does have a sense of awareness of his deficits and rightly appraises the gravity of his illness on the GDS.  In prior studies with our group he has amyloid imaging (when he was MCI) and is strongly amyloid positive.

Prior to enrollment he was evaluated in a memory clinic for subjective memory loss and executive dysfunction, but was found to be cognitively normal on neuropsych testing. In 2014 his ADNI diagnosis was changed to amnestic mild cognitive impairment, a diagnosis was maintained at the 2016 visit. In reviewing the subject's neurocognitive test scores, his LM I and II have improved significantly since 2011. His Trails A and B scores are stable and not in the impaired range. Although his CDR global score has been 0.5 in the past three visits, including a 0.5 for memory, we believe this is consistent with the subject's long-standing subjective memory complaints. There is no objective test evidence that the subject has had memory or executive function decline since 2011. Rather, the evidence suggests a surprising improvement in logical memory (e.g., LM II score increased from 16 in 2011 to 24 in 2017).

No history of stroke or head trauma. 
 
MMSE has stayed the same from 08/2017 (25/30) within a span of one year and domains are memory/orientation and questionable visual spatial. MMSE is not very sensitive for executive decline (as a MoCA would be more so). This decline in MMSE score is consistent with a neurodegenerative disease. However suspect a full Neuropsychological battery would find significant impairment in both memory and executive domains.

things, forgets names of recent and even long time acquaintances. It takes him 
longer to get his work set up. He also noticed word finding difficulty

hired a book-keeper for his financial matters. He continues to cook, but most 
often with a microwave and eats lunch at restaurant each day. He denies having 
difficulty with driving, but Mike notes a recent incident where he struck a 
parked car in a parking lot. He has been evaluated for driving in the VAPAHCS

He self reports more cognitive symptoms than his wife reports. He endorses most of his difficulties with recall and executive atm functioning. When reviewing treatment for depression he is only on Buproprion 150 mg BID since 11/2015 and for cognition he is on 10 mg QHS since 06/2017. He is not in counseling.

His GDS on today's evaluation is 8 which is increased from 3 on 12/2016; indicating inclining depression since last eval. His last MOCA was 26/30 and this eval his MOCA was 25/30. His IE MOCA in 2011 was 24/30. His animal fluency was 28 on IE, 16 on last eval and is 24 today. His MMSE was 29/30 on IE, 26/30 on last and is 26/30 today. Altogether, he has variability on testing with no clear defined decline since IE.
